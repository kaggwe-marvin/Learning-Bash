# Hands-On Exercise

-Open your terminal.
Use cd to navigate to your home directory (cd ~).
Create a new directory with mkdir practice.
Move into this directory with cd practice.
Inside practice, create three directories: docs, images, and code.
List the contents of the current directory (ls). You should see your newly created directories.
Move into the docs directory (cd docs).
Create a text file named notes.txt using the touch command (touch notes.txt).
List the contents of the docs directory. You should see the notes.txt file.
Move back to the parent directory (cd ..).
List the contents again. Confirm that you're in the practice directory.
Copy the notes.txt file from docs to the code directory using cp.
List the contents of the code directory to verify the file copy.

pwd - print the name of the current working directory
